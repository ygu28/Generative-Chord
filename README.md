# AI Vtuber
This project aims to build an AI VTuber that can interact with live chat on platforms like Bilibili or Twitch, similar to Neuro-Sama but definitely less capable. It will have real-time chat interaction, memory, context generation, text-to-speech (TTS), and Live2D animation control. It will be hosted on VTube Studio (a software that allows you to control your Live2D Model in real time) and integrate with live-streaming platforms.
## Objectives
*  Develop a chatbot capable of real-time interaction with live chat messages using large language models.  
*  Enable Live2D model control in response to chat messages.  
*  Integrate TTS such as GPT-SoVITS with desired sound for live voice interactions.  
*  Ensure context-aware responses using memory to enhance engagement.  
*  Launch the AI VTuber on live-streaming platforms like Bilibili or Twitch.
