# AI Vtuber
*This project aims to build an AI VTuber that can interact with live chat on platforms like Bilibili or Twitch. She will have real-time chat interaction, memory, context generation, text-to-speech (TTS), and Live2D animation control. It will be hosted on VTube Studio (a software that allows you to control your Live2D Model in real time) and integrate with live-streaming platforms.*
## Objectives
*  Develop an AI agent capable of real-time interaction with live chat.  
*  Enable Live2D model control in response to chat messages.  
*  Integrate text-to-speech (TTS) such as GPT-SoVITS with desired sound for live voice interactions.  
*  Ensure context-aware responses using memory to enhance engagement.  
*  Launch the AI VTuber on live-streaming platforms like Bilibili and Twitch.
